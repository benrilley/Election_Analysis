3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received. 
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won. 
5. Determine the winner of the election based on the popular vote.

 ## Challenge Overview 
 The Challenge was to sort raw election data into a short concise 3 line table that clearly states candidate, number of votes received and percentage of total votes. 
 
 ## Challenge Summary 
 This was an extremely difficult challenge for me. I had to learn on the fly with the help of our great teachers, aides and fellow classmates really most of what I was doing wrong. It took hours of work and while I don't think I got it down 100% I am extremely proud of what I've managed to put together. The limitations of this code are endless. You can use this, obviously to sort election data, but taking it further you can use it to find what music charts the highest in a given set of states, counties, cities even countries. You can use it to find what movie theaters had the highest influx of viewers for specific movies to organize a weekend re-release. It was really cool to work on and have my brain think of other apploications as I was doing the work!
